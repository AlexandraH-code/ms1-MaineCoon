                    <h2>Origin</h2>
                    <p><em>Country Of Origin: America</em></p>
                    <p>The predecessors of the Maine coon were long-haired cats that sailors brought to American Maine
                        in the 1850s. These cats mated with the local short-haired cats. The offspring were large,
                        robust cats with semi-long fur and bushy tails reminiscent of a raccoon's tail, hence the name
                        maine coon (raccoon is called "raccoon" in English). The cats developed thick, heavy fur to
                        withstand the extreme cold of Maine's winters. Special Maine Coon shows were held as early as
                        the 1860s and the breed became a very popular pet. The Maine coon was imported to the UK in the
                        1980s.

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>The Maine Coon is the largest of all cat breeds and has a muscular body and sturdy legs. The head
                        has a square muzzle and large ears, which are wide at the base and set high. The long and thick
                        coat consists of underwool covered by glossy, waterproof overcoat. The fur is shorter on the
                        head, neck and shoulders and longer on the back, sides and tail. On the belly and hind legs, the
                        fur is thick and shaggy. The neck collar is stronger in males than in females. The tail is long
                        and bushy and the ears have tufts on the tip. The fur on the paws has a "snowshoe" effect. Maine
                        coons come in thirty or more colors. The eyes can be green, gold or copper colored; white cats
                        may have blue or different colored eyes.

                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>Maine Coons have a pleasant disposition / temper and are very playful and friendly. They enjoy
                        human company and make excellent pets. Perhaps their simple origins are the reason why you often
                        find them huddled together in all sorts of places. They enjoy being outdoors and should have the
                        opportunity to climb and play hunter. The main coon is known for its cooing soft voice.

                    <p>The Maine Coon appears to have a high risk of suffering from the heart disease hypertrophic
                        cardiomyopathy. In addition, the breed often suffers from hip dysplasia. Ask the breeder about
                        these conditions before buying a cat.

                    <h2>Nutrition And Feeding</h2>
                    <p>Each cat is unique and has its own taste in food. However, cats are carnivores and each cat must
                        obtain 41 different and specific nutrients from its food. The distribution of these nutrients
                        varies according to age, lifestyle and general health so it is not surprising that a growing,
                        energetic kitten needs a different balance of nutrients in its diet than a less active, older
                        cat. Other things to consider are feeding the right amount of food to maintain an ideal body
                        weight in accordance with feeding guides and taking into account individual preferences for wet
                        or dry food.

                        training and life experience. Talk to the cattery, if you are adopting, for more information
