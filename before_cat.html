              <h2>Things to think about before you make a decision</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Are you prepared to take responsibility for your cat for many years to come? If the Maine Coon is
                  healthy, it can live for 15-20 years.</li>
                <li>Do you know the basic needs of cats? It is well worth studying or taking a course before you decide.
                </li>
                <li>Do you have enough time for your cat? The Maine Coon is a social breed that prefers to have company
                  around the clock.</li>
                <li>Do you have enough space for a cat? The Maine Coon needs to get enough exercise. Therefore, it needs
                  access to claw trees and high places, so that it has enough room to run. It loves interactive games and
                  enjoys playing with all family members.</li>
                <li>Do you have the financial means to have a cat? In addition to the running costs such as cat food, cat
                  litter, insurance, vaccinations, there are additional costs for a veterinarian in the event of illness and
                  possible accidents, etc.</li>
                <li>Do you know the rules for caring for cats? To find out what regulations exist, you can contact the
                  authority responsible for regulations concerning pets where you live.</li>
              </ul>

    <!-- Before Buying section -->

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
          <h2>Things to think about before buying</h2>
          <p>When you've made the decision to expand the family, there are still a few things to think about before it's
            time to buy (your cat).</p>
          <h3>Finding the right breeder</h3>
          <p>Get in touch with several breeders and create a good relationship, e.g. by informing the breeder a little
            about yourself and your plans with the kitten (if you intend to exhibit, get a litter, if you have other
            animals at home and so on).
            Remember that it is important that the breeder feels that the cat is going to a good and stable home. Just
            like you, the breeder also has the right not to complete the purchase/sale if it does not "click".
          </p>
          <h4>Get as much information as possible about the breeder</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Find out which association and cat club the breeder belongs to.
              It is important to check that the cat you intend to buy is really a purebred cat. In order for the breeder
              to register a litter of cats and obtain pedigrees, he/she must be a member of a club that records
              pedigrees. If you have questions or comments about the breeder - contact the cat club.
            </li>
            <li>Ask if you can meet the kitten at the breeder's home.
              Seeing the kitten in its home environment - together with the mother cat and any siblings where it is safe
              - is always good. A healthy and healthy cat should be curious, lively and alert and look healthy.
            </li>
            <li>Do you have enough time for your cat? The Maine Coon is a social breed that prefers to have company
              around the clock.
            </li>
            <li>Does the breeder have a permit if required?</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Get as much information about the cat as possible</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Are the kitten's parents suitable for breeding?<br>
              Animals must not be used for breeding if:
              <ol>
                <li>they have illnesses or disabilities that can be inherited,</li>
                <li>they are or are very likely to be carriers of a recessive predisposition in a double set for
                  disease,</li>
                <li>they are or with a high probability are carriers of a simple recessive predisposition to disease,
                  unless mating takes place with an individual who has been found to be free of the corresponding
                  predisposition,
                </li>
                <li>the mating combination based on available information increases the risk of disease or disability in
                  the offspring,
                </li>
                <li>they exhibit behavioral disorders in the form of excessive fear reaction or aggressive behavior in
                  unprovoked or everyday situations for the animal, or
                </li>
                <li>they lack the ability to reproduce naturally.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Are the kitten's parents health tested for HD (Hip Dysplasia) and HCM (Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy)?
            </li>
            <li>What is the cat's temperament like? What does it have to take after?</li>
            <li>Is the cat socialized?<br>
              What kind of environment is it used to? Has it met children, other animals, ridden in a car, been outside?
              How is it used to being handled? How does brushing, claw trimming, etc. work?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Insure your cat</h3>
          <p>Once you have bought a cat, you should insure it. Accidents and illness can affect the cat and veterinary
            costs can be high!
          </p>
          <h3>The price</h3>
          <p>What a Maine Coon costs can vary and is up to each breeder. Some breeders have differentiated prices
            depending on whether the cat is for companionship, exhibition or breeding, while other breeders charge the
            same price regardless of how promising it is or what it is intended for.
          </p>
          <h3>An older cat</h3>
          <p>If you are interested in buying an older cat, or older kitten, that possibility may also exist. Sometimes
            older cats can do well to be relocated to a home where they get all the attention by themselves and don't
            have to compete with several other cats.
